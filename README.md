# INTEGRA

The wiki is available at https://github.com/nicolopinci/INTEGRA/wiki and describes how to use the tool in detail. 
One of the central features of INTEGRA, for example, is the possibility to plot a custom graph. For this purpose, the user should follow this procedure:

* Import a soccer dataset
* Select it from the dataset list
* Wait until the preset graphs and the + button are loaded
* A modal window will appear
* `inData` is the representation of the parsed data as a map
* `outData` will be used by Plot.ly to plot the custom graph
* It is now possible to write Javascript code to manipulate the initial data properly.
